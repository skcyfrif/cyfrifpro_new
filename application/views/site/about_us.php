  <h2>Finance & Accounting- The Bloodline</h2> 
  <p>The finance and accounts function is the lifeline of a business as well as individual given the delicacy and structure of every business model, the financial health index of an organisation holds the key to survival and growth. However, compliance and regulatory demands on a significant rise and catering to these functions take a lot more dynamism and full-time effort. Compliance being the order of the day, consumes an organisation’s maximum resources and inherently limits effective core functions. Thus, with the entire wing of finance and accounts outsource to a team of trained professionals to deal with compliance and regulatory environments, there is so much more resource that an organisation has to expend on the growth of its business. With incorporation of dynamic analysis structures and prudent processes, we at Cyfrifpro, have been able to transform and rewiring finance & accounts functions from within that have enabled companies to adopt seamlessly to governance and policy changes, while having eased the work load on accounting efforts. </p>
